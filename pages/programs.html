    <h2>Debian Package Autobuilder</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>This video shows a auto build bot for continuous integration that I wrote. The front end is
    writen in JQuery, Bootstrap, Css3, html5, Web sockets, HighChartsJS and ChartsJS. The back
    end server is written in Go, The back end web sockes listener is wrote in C++,Qt the email client
    that sends out emails was wrote with perl, and python and some simple bash scripts. The Auto
    builder and packager was wrote in python, C++ and some bash. The file readers and writers where
    written in Qt.
    </p>

    <p>
      How it works, Make a git hub repo. Link your get hub repo to the auto builder. Anytime that
    there is a push it builds the debian packages for the either Ubuntu or Debian. It builds for these
    arch's. x86_64, i386, and armhf . if the build fails it sends out emails to the admin. If it passes it
    pushes the packages up to your package repository and inserts the new version into the repository
    tree. More information can be found in the second video.
    </p>
